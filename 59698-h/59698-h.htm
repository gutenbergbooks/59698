<p>The following observations

your approbation, are now published
at your request, and presented
to you as a testimony of
the author’s respectful regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>Candour requires him to acknowledge
that some gentlemen
of the Society were averse to the
publication, judging that the free
censure of popular opinions would
rather provoke resentment than
produce reformation. Not deterred
from his purpose, he has
availed himself of their friendly
cautions to obviate some objections
which may be made to the
design.</p>

<p>The account of the earlier
chymists may, on a superficial
view, appear superfluous; but
it was thought necessary to illustrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
the Medical History of Antimony,
and to shew how little
credit is due to those writers
whose exaggerated praises of that
medicine have contributed so
much to mislead and abuse mankind.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the
author has not himself assayed
the antimonial ores, nor repeated
the chymical processes. But by
drawing the chymical and mineralogical
materials from other
sources, all imputation of prejudice
or partiality, on his part,
is prevented, since he appeals to
the testimony of the patrons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
antimony themselves, for the authenticity
of the facts by which
some of their opinions are subverted.</p>

<p>Remedies have often acquired
reputation without sufficient
evidence of their innocence and
efficacy. Some have been introduced by
an injudicious application of the theory
of the schools, others by rash and precipitate
conclusions drawn from partial
experiment, and many by a refined species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of imposition on the credulity of
mankind, veiled under the specious pretence
of strict morality, extensive benevolence,
and disinterested love of science.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that a steady exertion
of these arts should prevail,
when we consider that physicians, whose
duty it is intelligently to examine these
boasted remedies, and if frivolous or
dangerous, to expose and resist the patrons
of them, have too often contributed
to establish the deceit. Some are
borne along by the torrent of vulgar
prejudice; while others stand aloof
beholding, with indignant pride, the
triumph of imposture; and many
judging a compliance with popular
prejudices their surest and safest course,
unite in supporting error and imposition,
and in confirming the most pernicious
practices.</p>

<p>Thus is the publick confidence betrayed,
the art of physick brought into
contempt, bold and extravagant assertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
gain ground, and dangerous remedies
are established.</p>

<p>The common interest calls us to expose
these intrigues, since men do not
knowingly sacrifice life and health, but
are unwarily misled by misrepresentation.
Let us therefore unite in promoting
a safe and effectual practice,
and in repelling the common enemies
of science and of mankind.</p>

<p>Among the delusions of the present
age, one of the most dangerous is the
universal belief of the perfect innocence
and superlative efficacy of antimony.
The extensive use of this mineral demands
our particular attention, since it
not only obtains among regular physicians,
but has been generally adopted
in domestic practice. But if its reputation
shall appear to have been raised
by falsehood or misrepresentation, it
becomes us to resist that tyrannical
fashion by which it hath been established.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Some Account of the ancient Chymists, and
of their opinions concerning Antimony.</i></span></h2>

<p>Antimony was originally used
by the Chymists, who, as they
pretended to preternatural illumination,
affected to conceal from the vulgar
and profane, the sacred mysteries
of the adepts, who arrogantly stiled
themselves the favourites of Heaven.
An exact chronological account is not
to be expected in an art which took its
rise among illiterate Miners, and in the
most superstitious country in the world.
How long it was cultivated by the
lower set of people, with whom it
originated, is uncertain; but Trismegistus,
having, as is believed, first treated
it in a scientifical manner, has been
honoured by his successors as the Inventor
and founder of the art. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
is stiled a philosopher, a priest and a
King, is said to have been instructed
in all manner of learning, to have
been the Inventor of medicine among
the Egyptians, and to have lived about
fifteen hundred years before the christian
æra, or according to some about the
time of Moses.</p>

<p>Chymistry, among the Egyptians,
was joined to the magic art, it passed,
thus corrupted, from them to the
Arabians, where it was rendered still
more unintelligible; and, in the course
of the pilgrimages, and warlike expeditions
to the holy land, it was imported
into Europe, during the dark
ages of ignorance, where it was still
further vitiated by those impostors who
scrupled not to corrupt the christian
doctrines, and to pervert a religion,
instituted to promote the happiness of
mankind, to the purpose of oppressing
them, by erecting, under the pretence
of obedience to its precepts, a temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and spiritual dominion over all
whom they could intimidate or deceive.</p>

<p>In these rude times, when the nations
of Europe were overwhelmed with ignorance
and slavery, it was not to be expected
that Chymistry could be much
reformed. The little learning of that
age was confined to the ecclesiastical
orders, who avowedly reprobated all
knowledge which was not derived from
divine illumination.</p>

<p>Hence we find the chymical writers
of that period boasting of their weakness,
yielding up all confidence in their
faculties, glorying in what they termed
poverty of spirit, which was a state
of absolute quietism, and betaking
themselves to the invocation of supernatural
assistance, on which they depended
for that information which had
been wisely placed within the reach of
their natural capacity. An implicit
submission to these monkish tenets
was, however, strictly enforced, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
who presumed to depart from them,
called forth the severest censures of the
catholic church.</p>

<p>But, even in those times of ignorance
an ecclesiastic arose worthy of a
better age and happier fate. Roger
Bacon, undaunted by the terrors of
the church, boldly attempted to stem
the torrent of superstition, and recal
the world to truth and sound philosophy.
Such of his writings as yet remain,
are composed in a rational, manly
stile, void of hypocrisy and dissimulation.
He leads us to examine the
works of nature and of art, chastly
distinguishing those from the sacred
truths of revelation, and clearly demonstrating
their united operations to
be far more wonderful than the pretended
miracles of those who boasted
of supernatural assistance, whom he
justly censures as amusing the ignorant
with the fumes of drunkenness, or the
ravings of a distempered brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The age in which he lived was
too much depressed to be roused by
his vigorous efforts; and his laudable
attempts to emancipate the christian
world from that slavish ignorance
in which it was held, were, for
very obvious reasons, severely censured
by the Roman church: he was arraigned,
condemned, and cast into prison,
where he was exhausted by a tedious
confinement and severe penance<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
and soon after fell a victim to the vengeance
of his enemies.</p>

<p>The papal tyranny having thus prevailed
against the strenuous efforts of
this rational and intelligent philosopher,
it was easy, under the pretence of exalted
devotion, to suppress more feeble attempts
toward improvement and reformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>But those high pretensions to extraordinary
sanctity have been so often
used as a cloak, by men of an intriguing
spirit, that they are now justly
deemed suspicious; and we need only
look into the lives and writings of the
ecclesiastical chymists to be convinced
that they were assumed by them, to
cover their ignorance, ambition, and
dissolute manners. An overweening
conceit of their own opinions, and an
arrogant contempt for those of others,
is, notwithstanding all their pretensions
to humility and self-denial, the genuine
characteristic of those hypocritical
writers. Thus we find them extolling
themselves to the disparagement of all
mankind. <i>Ye doctors of physick and
surgery</i>, says Basil Valentine, <i>come to
me, a religious person, and servant of
God, I will shew you what ye have never
seen, I will make manifest to you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
way of health and salvation, which you
have not yet known</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In delivering their chymical processes,
an invocation of God is the first precept,
and they, then, proceed in the
name of the Lord. But not content
with having magnified themselves beyond
their equals, they address their
disciples in the stile and manner of the
founder of the christian religion: <i>I
warn you</i>, says the same ecclesiastical
chymist, <i>my disciple and apostle, if you
would imitate me, you must take up your
cross, and suffer as I have suffered, and
learn to bear persecution as I also have
done</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>: and having thus made themselves
equal with God, they proceeded
to disclaim all dependance on the supreme
Being, declaring, in their pride,
that, if God would not assist them,
they would rather consult the Devil
than the works of former writers<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the chymists were more intitled
to our confidence; the extravagant
praises which they bestow on antimony,
would justly render their evidence
suspected. Not content with
attributing to it an infallible efficacy in
the cure of diseases, they assert its influence
over the temper and disposition
of the mind, and seriously affirm that
it disposes to probity and chastity.
Notwithstanding these miraculous effects
they scruple not to own that, in
its original state, it is of a poisonous nature;
but they pretend that they can
easily convert the most noxious substances
into salutary medicines, and
the mildest nourishment into deadly
poison; and thus is antimony rendered
an infallible cure for all diseases, and
honey destructive to the human race<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The writings of modern physicians
are indeed free from those gross absurdities;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
yet the high character given,
even by them, to antimonial medicines,
so greatly exceeds all bounds of probability,
that we shall be justified in
witholding our assent, till it is supported
by proofs bearing some proportion
to the boldness of their assertions.</p>

<p>By the study of mathematics a habit
of accuracy and precision is acquired,
and it may be suspected that chymistry
leads to credulity; or else, some of the
modern chymists, after the example of
their predecessors, have craftily obtained
wealth and fame, by the most criminal
practices. Upon the whole, the evidence,
as well ancient as modern, concerning
the superlative efficacy of antimony
is to be suspected, and it is necessary
impartially to enquire into its
natural history, chymical analysis, and
medical effects.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_II">SECTION II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Natural History of Antimony.</i></span></h2>

<p>Antimony is of different
kinds: by some it is described
a blackish mineral substance staining
the hands, full of long, shining needle-like
striæ, hard, brittle, and considerably
heavy. It is found in different
parts of Europe, as Bohemia,
Saxony, Transylvania, Hungary,
France, and England, commonly in
mines, intermixed with earth and
stones. Sometimes it is blended with
the richer ores of silver, which renders
the extraction of that metal difficult,
volatilising a part of the silver, or, in
the language of the miners, robbing the
ore<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hungarian and Transylvanian,
of which little or none comes to us,
is esteemed much the best for medicinal
use. The English seems of all
others the least proper for that purpose,
frequently containing a portion
of lead<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, which is not separable by
any of the common methods of purification,
or else the English miners
are unacquainted with the method of
purifying it in foreign countries.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Hunter has in
his museum, eighteen curious specimens
of antimony, very different from
each other: some are covered with a
white calcareous crust; some, in external
appearance, resemble cobalt<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; others
the lead ores; and others, those of arsenic;
some are almost perfectly black; some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
have red striæ, interspersed throughout
the ore, and others shining spiculæ
like polished steel. But as they
have not yet been assayed, no very probable
conjecture can be formed concerning
their component parts, nor of
the proportion they bear to each other.</p>

<p>Chymists have not been sufficiently
accurate in pointing out the signs by
which the purity of this mineral is to
be distinguished. Basil Valentine says,
it is of two kinds which are very different,
one is beautiful and possessed
of some of the properties of gold.
The other has more of sulphur and
not so much affinity to gold, it is
distinguished by beautiful, white shining
striæ. The one is much to be
preferred to the other for the purpose
of the medicine as well as alchymy<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>Some direct antimony to be tried
by rubbing the powder with a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dog’s tooth upon yellow paper, where,
if it leaves a red spot it is pure.
Others order a tincture to be made
with spirit of vinegar and evaporated
on an iron plate, and if it leaves a
red powder it is reputed good. It is
also said to be good, when it is not
spongy, but heavy, and when it evaporates
by a strong heat<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>The earlier chymical writers who
praise it highly, scruple not to own
that it is, in its natural state, a virulent
poison. Basil Valentine, its
greatest advocate, though he admits
that it is given by farmers to their
cattle, when they intend to make them
fat and smooth; yet declares it to be
truly poisonous, and strictly prohibits
the use of it unprepared.</p>

<p>Paracelsus, as well as Glauber,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
recommends it as an external application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in the cure of cancers, judging
it superior even to arsenic in all
corroding diseases, and expresses his
ardent wishes that it should be substituted
in place of all other remedies,
that the reproach of the chirurgical
art might be removed, and our humanity
might not be offended with such
numbers of maimed and mutilated
objects<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. He highly extols its preparations,
and attributes to some of
them the power of giving the bloom
of youth to decrepit old age, but strictly
prohibits its internal use unprepared,
and treats particularly of the baneful
influence of the crude mineral, in his
book on the diseases occasioned by working
in mines and in metals.</p>

<p>Some later writers are silent concerning
its noxious qualities, and others
positively assert, that antimony, in its
crude state, is not a poison, but if
given from four grains to half a drachm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an excellent resolvent and purifier of
the blood.</p>

<p>Dr. James in the universal English
Dispensatory says, <i>it is astonishing that
so many physicians, and some of them men
of learning, should so strenuously oppose the
introduction of antimony into medicine,
and without any manner of evidence or
experience, treat it as a deleterious poison.
For it appears that antimony reduced to
powder is neither emetic nor cathartic:
though, if given in large quantities, it may
perhaps, by its weight, gently loosen the
belly; and so far is it from being deleterious,
that it is an excellent alterative in the
mange of horses, and a salutary medicine
in some diseases of men as well as cattle.
It is therefore astonishing that any instances
should occur of patients who have
been deserted by physicians, and afterwards
found a remedy in antimony, administered
by quacks, who do not so much as pretend
to any degree of medicinal knowledge.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>But the arguments drawn from the
example of giving antimony in large
quantities to horses, do not prove its
innocence in the human body. The
crocus metallorum is used by farriers
to the quantity of an ounce or two in
the day, yet a few grains of this preparation
produce in men the most violent
and dangerous effects.</p>

<p>The authority of Basil Valentine,
which is brought to prove the innocence
of crude antimony is also directly
perverted, and the story of his
having introduced it into medicine from
an accidental observation of its effects
upon swine, is no where to be found
in the Triumphal Chariot of Antimony.
Basil Valentine, <i>to whom</i>, says the
same author, <i>we are obliged for discovering
the medical uses of antimony, first using it
internally, and enriching medicine with
many of its preparations, having thrown
away some antimony which he had used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the fusion of metals, and observing some
swine, who had accidentally eaten it, to
purge considerably, and afterwards become
sleek and fat, took the hint of trying what
it would do in human bodies</i>.</p>

<p>But this matter is very differently
represented by Basil Valentine himself.
Let mankind, says he, be instructed,
that antimony not only purifies
and refines gold, and frees it from
all metals and every foreign matter,
but accomplishes the same in men and
cattle by its innate virtue. I shall explain
this by a rude experiment. If a
farmer should set apart any animal, a
hog for instance, to be fed, let him give
the animal half a drachm of antimony,
for two or three days, mixed
with his food, so that he may be purged,
by which he will not only acquire
an appetite and become sooner fat; but
if he labours under any disease the antimony
will expel it<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. But I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not advise any person to give crude
antimony to the human race, as a medicine,
for he that would use it with
safety and success, must first know the
method of preparing it, in which the
greatest part of the mystery consists;
and an imprudent physician, who gives
it without this necessary knowledge,
will do more hurt than good<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>This is not taking a hint from the
effects of antimony on swine, but a
direction to give it to those animals
when they are to be made fat. It
is the more necessary to point out this
mistake, since Basil Valentine is quoted
by this author, as having maintained the
safety and efficacy of crude antimony,
though he constantly asserts it, in its
natural state, to be virulent and poisonous.
<i>I shall be the first</i>, says he, <i>to
protest and exclaim against those, who, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ignorant of the method of preparation,
give poisons to mankind, for mercury, orpiment,
and antimony are poisonous, and
will ever remain so, unless they are fitly
prepared</i><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>: and again, <i>If antimony is
given without being prepared, it will
quickly kill the patient</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>Hence it appears, though he highly
extols the preparations of antimony,
yet he not only exclaims against using
it in its crude state, but ranks
it with orpiment, and declares it poisonous.</p>

<p>It may indeed be suspected that the
writers of that age went to the opposite
extreme, too easily admitting the
poisonous quality of these minerals,
which were the subject of their Chymical
operations, the more illustriously
to display, among the ignorant laity,
the supernatural powers of their mystical
art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet this difference of opinion, between
the earlier and some of the later writers,
may be otherwise accounted for, from
the present mode of purifying that
mineral before it comes into the hands
of the Chymists. It is not improbable
it may have been formerly sent to
them without any preparation, but it
is now separated from its natural impurities
at the mines, by fusion in an
earthen pot, whose bottom is perforated
with a number of holes, the
fusible antimony passing through, whilst
the infusible substances remain behind.
The melting vessel is let into another
pot, sunk into the ground, which serves
as a receiver. This last is of a conical
figure, and such is the shape of the
loaves of antimony met with in the
shops<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>But some of the modern chymists assert
that, if crude antimony is reduced
to so fine a powder that the shining
spiculæ cannot be seen, its operation is
similar to mild kermes mineral<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, and
Doctor James<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and the author of the
New Dispensatory<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, the greatest advocates
for its perfect innocence, admit,
that when acid, alcaline or oleaginous
food have been taken liberally, it has
proved violently emetic. It may therefore
be fairly concluded, even on their
authority, that the crude mineral contains
such active particles as may, by
accident or mismanagement be rendered
extremely virulent.</p>

<p>The best modern authors on mineralogy
who have carefully examined the antimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
ores, in their natural state, affirm
that all of them are arsenical; and
some of them were found in Carls ort,
in the mine of Salberg, about the end
of the last century, so similar to arsenical
ores as to be preserved in cabinets,
as specimens of arsenical pyrites,
their real nature remaining undiscovered,
till it was explained in the year
1748, by Mr. Van Swob master of the
mines, in a treatise communicated to
the royal academy of sciences at Stockholm<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Antimony also frequently contains a
portion of lead<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, the poisonous qualities
of which have been clearly demonstrated
by the learned Doctor Baker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in his elaborate critical dissertations
on that subject, published in the transactions
of the college of physicians of
London, and by the ingenious Doctor
Percival in his observations and experiments
on the poison of lead.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_III">SECTION III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Chymical Properties and Analysis
of Antimony.</i></span></h2>

<p>It appears from Dioscorides, Pliny
and Galen, that in their time antimony
was not chymically examined,
nor used internally though they recommend
it as an external application.
It is not surprising that modern
chymists should differ concerning
its constituent parts, since they cannot
be separated without losing something
in the operation. Their proportions
are also various in different specimens
of the crude mineral, a pound of some
yielding ten or eleven ounces of regulus,
whilst others scarce afford eight
ounces<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever may be their opinion
concerning the effects of crude antimony,
they are almost unanimous in
affirming, that it contains a portion of
arsenic, which by different management,
may be either converted into an
efficacious remedy or a deadly poison.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It is a fact, says Hoffman, proved beyond
all doubt among the chymists,
that antimony is composed of sulphur
and a mercurial or arsenical substance<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
The same is asserted by Stahl. Antimony,
says he, consists of two or three
mineral substances, sulphur, a portion
of arsenic, and an imperfect metallic
matter. That arsenic enters its composition
is proved by the red tinge of
sulphur of antimony; its great power
of vomiting, and that sickness of stomach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and faintness with which its operation
is attended; by the resemblance
of glass of antimony, to the saturnine
arsenical glass; by its solution in aquaregia,
and many other appearances. But
it is particularly demonstrated, by
the purity of antimony, which is regenerated
from regulus and pure sulphur,
which is much finer and milder
than vulgar or native antimony<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>The author of the New Dispensatory,
however, in opposition to these
weighty authorities, and to the concurring
testimony of almost all the chymists,
affirms, that this opinion, however
plausible, does not seem to have
any just foundation. Nothing arsenical,
he says, has ever been separated
from pure antimony. The most violent
antimonial preparations are rendered
inactive by means which do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lessen the poisonous quality of arsenic,
and the most inactive are rendered virulent
by operations in which arsenic
would either be dissipated, or its violence
abated<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>This opinion, contradicted by the general
voice of mineralogical and chymical
writers, since it is not supported by
more convincing proofs, should not
have been published in a book intended
for the use of every pupil in pharmacy;
if the prevailing opinion of the poisonous
quality of antimony should be
erroneous, it cannot affect the lives of
mankind, but if it is well founded,
what words can express the dangerous
tendency of a false doctrine so universally
propagated!</p>

<p>He has not indeed treated this subject
with his usual accuracy, for with Hoffman
and other celebrated chymists, he
elsewhere compares antimony to arsenic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as well with respect to its virulence,
as the means of correcting it:
<i>Orpiment</i>, says he, <i>from which a perfect
arsenic is obtainable in notable quantity, is
when it participates more largely of sulphur,
almost perfectly innocent; and sulphur,
which restrains the power of the
antimonial semimetal, remarkably abates the
virulence of this poisonous mineral also</i><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>Poppius affirms, that an impure,
bituminous and arsenical sulphur, noxious
to the eyes, nose, and lungs, with
a blue flame and arsenical smell, which
cannot be endured without danger, is
raised during the calcination or sublimation
of antimony<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>Glauber also directs antimonial cups
to be made for the purpose of communicating
an emetic quality to acid liquors,
which according to him produce the
same effects as those prepared from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
orpiment<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; Boerhaave asserts that antimony
seems to be of the same nature
with arsenic<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; Macquer informs
us, that some of the antimonial
ores contain a portion of the
same poisonous mineral<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>; and Cronstedt
affirms that all of them are arsenical<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>Unless therefore those modern chymists,
who assert the perfect innocence
of antimony, expect from us that implicit
confidence which their predecessors,
who held a very different opinion,
rigorously exacted, it cannot, on their
authority, be admitted that it does not
contain arsenic. Wonderful as the
works are which they have atchieved,
many secrets of nature have escaped
their researches, which may hereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
be discovered, and many will, undoubtedly,
elude all human investigation.</p>

<p>Nor is more credit due to those who
assert that all arsenical particles are volatilised,
and carried off by the force
of fire; the crocus, regulus and glass
of antimony containing such subtil virulent
particles as must for ever escape
observation, since without losing in
any degree their specific gravity, they
impart, almost inexhaustibly, an emetic
power to wine and other liquors, and
the operation of these essences of antimony,
as they have been emphatically
called, is similar to those of arsenic.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>But although, in opposition to the
testimony of the best chymical writers,
it should be granted that there is no
arsenic in antimony, it cannot be
affirmed, that it does not contain poison,
since by unfolding its texture by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the force or fire, it is rendered highly
virulent; and by the addition of various
substances, in the stomach, it becomes
violently emetic<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>By those who assert the perfect innocence
of antimony, and extol its
virtues, orpiment is allowed to be a
poisonous substance, and giving it as
a medicine, is declared a practice too
dangerous to be followed<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, yet it
is ranked by Hoffman with antimony.
It ought to be remarked, says he, that
orpiment was known to the ancient
philosophers and physicians, and universally
deemed a poison, and to this day
is sold for arsenic. Yet it does not,
when taken internally, give any molestation,
either by vomiting or purging,
and may be given, in a large
quantity, to dogs, without hurting
them. But if it is exposed to the fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
then, indeed, it acquires a poisonous
quality, as is also the case with antimony,
which, though in its natural
crude state, it is rather a medicine
than a poison, yet when melted by fire
it exerts a violent emetic power<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>Crude white arsenic, the most virulent
poison of that tribe, is not always
baneful<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. It is now more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
twenty years since it was taken in large
quantity by four persons, on whom it had
no other effect than, what is usually produced
by antimonial preparations, to
excite violent vomiting. All of them
were lately, and, I believe, are still in
perfect health. To this I was an eyewitness,
and took large lumps of white
arsenic out of the pot in which their
victuals were prepared. It happened
at Kelso, in the shire of Roxburgh,
and is well known in that country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I was a few years afterwards, desired
to visit a gentleman in Northumberland,
who had taken white arsenic: it
operated in the same manner, and for several
years after this accident he continued
in his usual health.</p>

<p>Thus far does arsenic resemble antimony,
but their affinity is still more
strongly asserted by Hoffman. While,
says he, the sulphureous part of antimony
is intimately combined with the
arsenical or reguline<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>; it cannot exert
its violence. For mineral poisons cannot
act or become noxious, till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
poisonous parts are freed from their
union with those which correct their
virulence.</p>

<p>But that mineral sulphur has a power
of correcting poison, is clearly proved
by that experiment which shews, that
arsenic, the greatest poison, being melted
on a slow fire, with an equal portion of
mineral sulphur, is converted into a
mass, almost void of virulence; and if
regulus of antimony is fused with an
equal portion of the same sulphur, it
immediately loses its drastic power<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>This theory probably introduced an
arsenical medicine into practice at
Berlin, where Hoffman, who was physician
to the king of Prussia, resided.
Newman, professor of chymistry and
director of the Royal Elaboratory and
Dispensatory in that city, observes, that
<i>chymistry is capable of converting sundry
poisons into remedies; thus the virulent antimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
regulus is changed, by that art,
into the mild diaphoretic antimony; and
some have been hence induced to imagine,
that arsenic might also be corrected
and rendered safe, and have even ventured
to put so dangerous a speculation in practice.
A preparation of arsenic with nitre
has been actually sold at Berlin, and
in other places, under the title of a specific
febrifuge</i><a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><i>.</i></p>

<p>There is, in many instances, a strong
analogy not only between antimony
and orpiment, but the more virulent
poison of white arsenic; and
those who have been bold enough to
use that poisonous mineral as a medicine,
have found, in its preparations,
a more certain and efficacious remedy
than in those of antimony. The illustrious
Stahl gives some account of a
famous fever powder, which obtained
great reputation in Germany, and was
used by most of the nobility in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
neighbourhood. This celebrated chymist
does not deny its great efficacy,
but, alarmed by a suspicion of poison
in its composition, earnestly declaims
against its use: it was at length acknowledged
to be a preparation of
white arsenic<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>The same fever-powder, or a similar
preparation, was used, with great success,
by the German Physicians and Surgeons,
in the late Flanders war. It was also
introduced among the English, but the
late Mr. Pringle, Inspector General of
the British hospitals in Flanders, on
whose authority this fact is related,
alarmed at the danger and uncertainty
of this remedy, ordered all the preparations
of it to be destroyed. This gentleman
acknowledged it had proved successful,
but dropsies and visceral obstructions,
which sometimes followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the fevers in which it was given, were,
perhaps unjustly, ascribed to its use.</p>

<p>Some account of an arsenical fever-powder
is given by Doctor Werlhoff, late
physician to his Britannic Majesty at
Hanover. He mentions its being recommended
from successful experience by
Michael Friccius<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, who had used some
drachms of it, and by Sleuogtius<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, who
had given it with safety in fifty cases, but,
notwithstanding these and many other
recommendations, he expressly condemns
this dangerous remedy<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>Lemery also affirms, that many diseases
have been cured by giving four
grains of white arsenic in a large quantity
of water. It operates, according to
this intelligent chymist, by vomiting,
in the same manner as antimony. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he highly disapproves of using it as
an internal remedy<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>Poisons having been lately strongly
recommended for the cure of many
obstinate diseases, and generally adopted
in practice, the dread of them, wisely
implanted in our nature, is in a great
measure banished; and such is the influence
of novelty and fashion, and so
much has prejudice prevailed, that one
of the most eminent physicians in Europe
has been disgraced for exposing a
practice fraught with danger, and supported
by misrepresentation<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>But though the strong proofs of the
poison of antimony, drawn from its natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
history and chymical analysis,
should be rejected by prejudice or scepticism,
yet the easy transition of this
mineral, by the simplest processes and
slightest accidents, from a salutary medicine
to a deadly poison, has not yet,
been seriously denied.</p>

<p>It is found by chymists generally
to contain mercury, arsenic, lead, sulphur,
and sometimes copper, silver,
and other metals<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. When it is melted
by fire, or deflagrated with half its
weight of nitre, it becomes a poison.
But if antimony, or its regulus, is
mixed with an equal portion of common
salt, and calcined with a gentle
heat, stirring it constantly, and afterwards
washing it with pure water, it
becomes a gentle diaphoretic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The mildest preparation of antimony;
its white calx, which may be safely
taken to the quantity of some drachms,
if melted with an equal portion of nitre,
a little powder of charcoal, and a
small quantity of animal fat, is immediately
rendered poisonous.</p>

<p>If antimony is melted with a fourth
part of salt of tartar, a salutary medicine
is obtained; but if the same process
is performed with two or three
times that quantity of the salt, so nice
is the management of this wonderful
mineral, in place of a medicine it becomes
a poison<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>When antimony is combined with
other medicines, as it frequently is by
practical physicians, unless the composition
is directed with chymical skill, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be so changed, or, in the language of
the chymists, decomposed, as totally to
alter its usual qualities.</p>

<p>By marine acids the activity of antimonials
is increased, and they are rendered
corrosive, or virulently emetic
and purgative; but by the addition of
the nitrous acid this virulence is diminished
or destroyed, and they become
mild diaphoretics<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>Such being the uncertainty and variety
in the operation of antimonial
preparations, it cannot be improper,
since they are now in common family
use, to lay before the public the objections
against the general application of
them, which arise from the accurate
observations of the best chymists, and
most experienced physicians; since it is
not improbable, that many who deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
them out with a liberal hand, and with
the most charitable and benevolent intentions,
would dread the danger of
a drug, which though published as an
infallible remedy, may, without great
skill and precision in the direction of it,
in place of a remedy become a poison.</p>

<p>But the ultimate decision of this
point must depend on the real effects
of antimonial medicines on the human
body, which are therefore now to be
considered.</p>

<p>The limits to which dissertations
of this kind ought to be confined

a minute detail of the various antimonial
preparations which may be found
in every dispensatory. Those in most frequent
use are calx of antimony, crocus
of antimony, antimonial wine, tartar
emetic, and kermes mineral.</p>

<p>The virtues of calx of antimony are
variously represented by different writers,
some ascribing to it the power of
an excellent diaphoretic, others asserting
that it even proves violently emetic,
and others, among whom is the great
Boerhaave, declaring it a mere inert
earth intirely destitute of all medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
virtue. The College of Physicians of
London, who had formerly directed this
preparation, under the title of diaphoretic
antimony, thought proper, because
of the various opinions concerning
its operation, to change its
name to that of calx of antimony, till
its medicinal qualities should be better
ascertained<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>These different judgments can scarce
be supposed to have been delivered by
competent judges concerning the same
medicine, but may be accounted for
from the different manner in which the
process for making the calx may have
been conducted. The common nitre,
with which it is prepared, contains
some portion of sea-salt, and when that
abounds, the proportion of nitre being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
less, the calx may prove an active remedy<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<p>If it is not sufficiently calcined, or
perfectly freed from the reguline parts
by washing, such of these as remain,
may produce more sensible effects than
are to be expected when it is duly prepared,
and hence perhaps proceed the
contradictory opinions of chymists and
physicians concerning this antimonial
preparation.</p>

<p>But the assertion of its being a mere
inert earth, is not well founded, since
a small dose of it sometimes produces
violent effects; and it may be reduced
by fusion, with inflammable fluxes, into
pure regulus. It enters the composition
of a medicine described by the judicious
Doctor Morton, with which, in
three instances, he cured an obstinate
intermitting fever. In one case the
disease was of two years standing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in all of them had resisted a diligent
and skilful application of the Peruvian
bark. But these were the only opportunities
he had of trying it; for having
never met with any other case in which
that excellent febrifuge disappointed his
expectation, he deemed it an unpardonable
wantonness to use a precarious
remedy, while he was possessed of one
more certain and efficacious<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. It is
also recommended by Van Swieten in
the peripneumony, as a deobstruent and
expectorant<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>Crocus of antimony is made by
deflagrating equal parts of antimony
and nitre: it operates as a violent
emetic when given from two to six
grains. A preparation of this kind,
recommended to the London College of
Physicians by one of their own members,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
under the title of milder crocus
of antimony, as a medicine of mild
operation and eminently efficacious, was
inserted in their Dispensatory; but the
committee appointed to review and correct
it having had some comparative trials
reported to them of this and the
common crocus, which rendered them
dubious of their effects, were induced
to leave the matter to be further examined<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p>It is seldom prescribed: but an extraordinary
cure is said to have been performed
by the milk of an ass that had
drank water in which it was accidently
infused<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>; and from such an improbable
story, an eminent physician was induced
to use the milk of a goat which
drank the same kind of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Antimonial wine was formerly ordered,
in the London Dispensatory, to
be made, by infusing an ounce of powdered
glass of antimony in two pints of
claret; and is commended by Salmon,
as a strong vomit, under the name of
vinum rubellum.</p>

<p>The vinum benedictum is made by
infusing an ounce of crocus metallorum
in a pint and an half of Spanish white
wine. A third form is, to digest two
ounces of regulus of antimony in three
pints of white wine. This last preparation
is declared by Salmon to be an
excellent medicine in fevers and agues,
and in obstructions of the bowels,
emptying them of all evil humours.
It perfectly cures the falling-sickness,
convulsions, cramps, gout, sciatica and
almost all other disorders. Another
tincture of antimony is directed by the
same author, and is said, on account
of its many virtues, to be a gift sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from God. It cures the plague and all
pestilential fevers. A tincture of antimony
is also directed by Basil Valentine,
eight drops of which are said to
be a remedy for all diseases.</p>

<p>The simple infusion of crocus, glass, or
regulus of antimony in wine, if not more
efficacious, is at least less dangerous
than those preparations which are made
by more elaborate chymical processes,
since the accuracy and attention of
those who prescribe it, will not so readily
be defeated by the carelessness or
ignorance of an operative chymist. But
though it may be given with greater
safety than other antimonials, yet the
extravagant encomiums bestowed upon
it are contradicted by the testimony of
the faithful, attentive and judicious Sydenham.
That candid physician expresses
his wishes, that instead of the infusion
of crocus of antimony, we had safer
vomits sufficiently efficacious. When
called to infants, and observing a vomit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
indicated, whereby they might have
been preserved from danger, he durst
not give this infusion for fear of bad
consequences. He was cautious of giving
it, even to grown people, though,
when plentifully diluted, he found no
ill effect from it; but he positively declares
that, in a continued fever, it is
by no means safe to give it to children
under the age of fourteen; and expects
no other benefit from it, than what
might be obtained by milder emetics<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p>But the obsolete opinions of the universal
efficacy of antimonial wine, although
expressly contradicted by the
chaster judgement of Sydenham, were
again revived in their full force by Dr.
Huxham. In the year 1737 he recommended
the vinum benedictum, in a
manner that might rather have been
expected from the mystical chymists, in
times of ignorance and superstition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
than from an able and experienced physician,
in a liberal and enlightened
age<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. As he had obtained much influence
and authority in his profession,
his earnest recommendation could not
fail widely to extend the use of this
medicine in regular practice; and when
further experience induced him to speak
of it in more moderate terms, and
physicians to look out for less precarious
remedies, a new and infallible antimonial
medicine, known by the name
of the fever-powder, was published,
which brought us again back to the
abuse of antimonial preparations, which
had already been often exploded.</p>

<p>That which next became fashionable,
as having the greatest supposed resemblance,
in its operation, to the celebrated
fever-powder, was tartar emetic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
It is prepared by boiling equal quantities
of washed crocus of antimony and
crystals of tartar in water. This, as
being soluble in liquids, is said to be less
precarious in its effects than the other
solid preparations; yet the strength of it
greatly depends upon the manner of
conducting the process, for some of the
tartar, in the ordinary method, will be
apt to shoot by itself, retaining little of
the crocus. Some have therefore advised,
as soon as the solution is filtered,
to carry the evaporation much further
than is usually done, if not to the total
exhalation of the liquor<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Its effects,
however, are uncertain, six or eight
grains sometimes proving a mild emetic;
though in other cases, I have seen half
a grain operate so severely as to bring
on violent convulsions, and Newman
has known three or four grains prove
mortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Fatal consequences have also happened
from want of attention to the
different methods of preparing this
medicine. A Dutch physician, being
accustomed to an emetic tartar made
with salt of tartar, which was given
in doses of ten, twelve, or fifteen
grains, prescribed a like dose from a
German shop, by which the patient
vomited to death<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>Kermes mineral, a preparation similar
to golden sulphur of antimony,
has been vended as a quack medicine
in France and Germany, under the
title of Mineral Centaury, Kermes or
Alkermes Mineral, or Poudre des Chartreu,
and in England by that of Wilson’s
Panacæa, and Russel’s Powder.</p>

<p>The king of France was at length
persuaded by M. Dodart, his first physician,
to purchase it from M. La
Ligerie, a surgeon at Paris, and it was
made publick in the year 1720: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
like all other catholicons, has lost its
consequence since the secret has been
divulged, and the medicine found to be
a well-known preparation described by
Glauber,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the elder Lemery.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>How long this medicine was used by
the mystical chymists cannot be known,
since they seldom communicated any
of their processes excepting for a valuable
consideration, and under the
strictest obligation to secresy. But
Cristopher Farnner, who was a humble
retainer of Glauber’s, on the small
stock of chymical knowledge which he
had gleaned from him and from a servant
whom he seduced to betray his
master and discover his secrets, attempted
to become his rival, and set
the process for making the golden sulphur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of antimony to sale, at the price
of thirty rixdollars. Glauber, incensed
at his treachery, published his own
improved method of preparing this medicine,
which he calls a Panacea of
common antimony, and it has since
under different names, and with some
variation, been transcribed into most of
the chymical books<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>According to Geoffroy, as well as
the earlier chymists, it was esteemed
an universal medicine. It sometimes
vomits, often purges, and generally
operates by sweat and urine;
in a word, says this celebrated writer,
it promotes the feveral evacutions, according
to the different channels by
which nature may be disposed to throw
of the vitiated humours.</p>

<p>It is recommended in the small-pox
and measles, in obstinate autumnal
intermittents, in spitting of blood,
and other pulmonary complaints, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
chronic diseases arising from obstructions
in the bowels, in dropsies and in
the bloody-flux. It is made by boiling
antimony repeatedly in water, with a
certain proportion of alcaline salt, and
owes its virtues to a portion of regulus
being rendered soluble in water<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>But this manner of preparing it is
condemned by Hoffman; who affirms,
that the reguline or arsenical parts are
not sufficiently sheathed by the sulphureous,
as appears from many circumstances
which he mentions, but
especially from its violent emetic quality.
He recommends a different process,
by which he supposes the sulphur
to be so blended with the reguline,
or arsenical particles as to render it
a mild and effectual diaphoretic.</p>

<p>The fate of antimony and its preparations
has been as various as the
reports concerning their efficacy are
contradictory. They have been ranked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
among the wonders of the world,
and their virtues extolled beyond all
probability. They have again been
proscribed as baneful, and prohibited
under the severest penalties.</p>

<p>Those who used antimony in Rome
were sent to the gallies. It was prohibited
in France by an edict of parliament
in 1566; and in 1609 a physician
was expelled the faculty of Paris
for prescribing it. The edict was repealed
in 1650, and it was again received
into the number of purgatives;
but this having been found inconvenient
or dangerous, its general use was
prohibited by a new edict in 1668, and
it was only permitted to be prescribed
by Doctors of the faculty.</p>

<p>The opinions of different authors on
this subject have not been more various
than those of the same person at different
times. In the year 1737 Dr.
Huxham asserts, without reserve, that
no medicine is more safe or more efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
than Vinum Benedictum,
which, from a supposition of its possessing
all the powers of this mineral,
he calls essence of antimony<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. But
after almost twenty years further experience,
he declares, whoever would give
antimony with safety and success,
should be well acquainted with its analysis
and component principles, and
should know what different combinations,
preparations, and doses, will
effect, otherwise it may prove a poison
instead of a remedy<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>From what has already been advanced,
it will not be difficult to account
for these contradictory reports. Different
specimens of antimony when
dug out of the mines are not made up
of the same component parts; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is so changed by fusion, that different
pieces of the same lump are not of
equal virtue<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. There are few antimonial
preparations which may not be
made by various processes, none of
which can be conducted with such accuracy
as uniformly to produce a medicine
of invariable strength, and their
operation is rendered yet more precarious
by their combination with a variety
of humours, food, drink and
medicines in the stomach.</p>

<p>But since no judgment can be formed
from the opposite and contradictory opinions
of others, it may now be proper to
mention the result of my own experience
and observation. In one instance, I
have seen a dangerous pleuritic fever, of
seven days standing, accompanied with
an incessant cough, a hard, full, quick
pulse, laborious breathing, and violent
pain in the breast, perfectly cured in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
few hours by the use of antimonial
wine<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>A dropsy of two years standing, occasioned
by a tedious remitting fever,
and accompanied with an obstruction
in the liver, which had withstood the
diligent application of a variety of medicines,
under the direction of several
skilful practitioners, was cured in a
few days by a medicine which owed its
efficacy to tartar emetic<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>An obstinate dysentery, which had
long resisted many other methods of
cure, was perfectly removed by two
doses of the vitrum antimonii ceratum.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these signal instances
of the efficacy of antimonial medicines,
and by the universal prejudice in their
favour, I have used them in many
thousand cases, but never, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
slighter diseases with the same success.
When given with much attention and
caution, they have generally failed
where milder medicines have proved
effectual, and in some instances they
have been prejudicial.</p>

<p>In a recent dropsy and visceral obstructions
occasioned by a remitting
fever, tartar emetic was prescribed not
only without success, but with an apparent
aggravation of the symptoms,
which were afterwards perfectly removed
by the use of Peruvian bark,
snake-root and rhubarb<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>I have been desired to visit children
and some grown persons in fevers, attended
with convulsions, which were,
with good reason, attributed to the
misapplication of antimonials, and in
one case an imprudent use of them
was judged to be the cause of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Though it is asserted that antimonial
preparations may be so directed
as to vomit, purge, or sweat according
to the intention of the prescriber,
yet those who have had much experience
will not obstinately defend the
assertion, since nothing perhaps is more
difficult than to foretel their effects
when administered alone. If they are
combined with other medicines their
operation may be more certainly directed,
since by opium they may be
determined to the skin, by senna or
manna they may be carried off by the
intestines, and by an addition of ipecacuan
or oxymel of squills they may
be rendered emetic.</p>

<p>But much prudence and skill are requisite
in conducting the operation of
these compound medicines. For tho’
no danger were to be apprehended
from joining antimonials with emetics
or purgatives, yet, by unskilful combinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the peculiar efficacy of antimony
may be destroyed; and by
opiates those virulent particles may
be retained, and prove noxious, which
would have been carried off, without
any other inconvenience than what
might arise from the violence of their
operation.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the evidence in favour
of antimony and its preparations
is too slight to justify the exaggerated
encomiums with which it has been
extolled: it contains in its crude state,
and in all its preparations, such virulent
particles as may, by slight accidents,
become poisonous in the stomach:
well-attested instances of remarkable
cures performed by it are
few; cases in which it has failed or
been prejudicial, numerous; the reports
of chymists and physicians concerning
it are various and contradictory;
its effects are precarious, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
skill, experience and attention requisite
to conduct its operation than are
to be expected among the generality,
even of regular practitioners<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. It is
therefore very improper for common
use; and as there is no certain rule to
direct the management of it, every physician
must form his judgment by comparing
his own observations with the
opposite and contradictory assertions of
others.</p>

<p>It would be imprudent to reprobate
a medicine which, in some instances, has
certainly performed such cures as are
seldom obtained by milder methods.
No bounds are to be fixed to discreet
and experienced practitioners, who, on
mature deliberation, may determine
the propriety of hazarding, in particular
circumstances, a violent and precarious
remedy, and can conduct its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
operation with skill and sagacity. Yet
the present indiscriminate use of antimony,
which is now grown up into
a fashion too formidable to be attacked
with much hope of success, must,
after a candid and impartial examination,
be condemned as pernicious.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_V">SECTION V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Secret Antimonial Medicines, and
particularly of the fever-powder.</i></span></h2>

<p>If the difficulty of conducting the
operation of antimony, renders the
general application of it, in regular
practice, dangerous, it must, as a secret
remedy, in the hands of those who
have no medicinal skill, be still more
pernicious. But as some secrets, now,
universally extolled, are avowed, by
their proprietors, to be preparations
of antimony, let us next proceed to
examine their claim to the high character
which they have obtained. For
this purpose the fever-powder may
be selected, since if the impropriety
and danger of its general use should
be demonstrated, the arguments in favour
of less celebrated secrets will not
require a serious refutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Unpleasing as the task may be, and
however odious, to some, it may render
the man who undertakes it, yet the great
importance of life and health requires,
that the precepts of the most illustrious
physicians should not pass without
examination, nor secret and mysterious
remedies be adopted with implicit faith.</p>

<p>The devout solemnity with which
the fever-powder is ushered into the
world, the exorcisms against detractors
and malicious persecutors, and the
invocation of God to support his own
work, being in the usual stile of the
mystical chymists, require no comment.
<i>As there may be some</i>, says the Inventor,
<i>whose lucrative views may tempt
them to persecute me, and the method I
propose, with all the detraction and falsehood
which may be expected from self-interest
and unprovoked revenge, these I
shall advise to save themselves a good deal
of unnecessary trouble, and to let it alone;
for if it be of men it will come to nought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow
it</i><a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. When magical chymistry and
superstition reigned over the dark ages
of ignorance, this charm would have
secured it from all enquiry. But as
the sober light of religion and philosophy
hath now illuminated the world,
and displayed the absurdity of that
servile bondage which obstructed all
improvement, we may, notwithstanding
this solemn prohibition, with candor
and modesty, proceed to examine
the real merit of this boasted arcanum.</p>

<p>The process for making it has been
carefully concealed, while its being an
antimonial preparation, hath, with industry
and ostentation, been universally
published. From the view which
has already been given of the natural
history of antimony, its analysis and
chymical properties, its preparations
and their medical effects, it has, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
think, been clearly proved, that however
efficacious it may have been in
particular circumstances, and under
judicious management, yet there is not,
in unskilful hands, a medicine more
dangerous and destructive.</p>

<p>By a judicious regulation of the doses
of different preparations of antimony,
by guarding against the pernicious effects
which might arise from the virulent
particles which it contains, by directing
such food, drink, and medicines
as may promote its salutary operation,
and prohibiting those by which
it might be rendered noxious; skilful
and experienced physicians have been
able, in singular instances, to render
it a safe and efficacious remedy:
but when it has been accidentally or
imprudently given in too large doses<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>,
or joined with such food or medicines
as excite its poisonous qualities<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, it has
not only proved too violent in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
operations, but has been productive of
fatal consequences.</p>

<p>Had, therefore, the Inventor discovered
a method of divesting this Proteus-like
mineral of all pernicious qualities, and
rendering it a medicine invariably safe
and efficacious, however combined with
other remedies, or mixed with a variety
of humours, food, and drink in the stomach,
his powder would have been
more proper for common use, and
might have been trusted, in unskilful
hands, with less danger, than other
antimonial preparations. But it does
not in this respect lay any claim to superiority.
<i>Supposing</i>, says the Inventor,
<i>physicians perfectly well skilled in the
preparation and uses of it, that knowledge
will inform them, that nothing can
be added to it that will in any degree increase
its virtues; or rather that no addition
can be made to it that will not diminish
them</i><a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>By this frank declaration we understand
that the fever-powder retains
the mutability of antimony,
and is, from slight accidents, changed
from a salutary medicine to a noxious
substance; and hence proceeds the Inventor’s
anxiety to prevent improper
combinations. But the dread of dangerous
consequences, or some other
cause, has led him unwarily and
inconsistently to depreciate his powder,
and reduce it below all other antimonial
preparations; for though by
certain additions the virtues of antimony
may be diminished, yet by others
they may be improved; and this, it is
probable, from the known properties
of that mineral, will also hold with
the fever-powder, although the contrary
is here expressly asserted.</p>

<p>But, lest the assertion should give unfavourable
impressions, it is immediately
retracted; and we are told that, <i>occasion
may sometimes occur of employing, advantageously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a regimen, or even medicine,
when judgment directs and integrity presides</i><a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
and again: <i>It sometimes happens,
when little or no putrid bile is contained
in the stomach, bowels, &amp;c. &amp;c.
that the powder, though given in the largest
doses, will have no sensible operation of any
kind whatever. In these cases half, or a
whole paper should be repeated every four or
six hours. But on those occasions, it will be
proper to procure two stools in twenty
four hours, either by a clyster, which is
the most easy way, or by giving, with
every dose of the powder, from five to
ten grains of rhubarb</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><i>. But in some
constitutions where a putrid bile has very
much abounded, and for this reason the
stimulus of the medicine, added to that of
the bile, has been apt to operate more than
was sufficient, it has been necessary to reduce
the dose so low as two or three grains</i><a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>:
and thus, after a series of contradictions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the fever-powder, as might
have been expected, is declared to require
the addition of other medicines,
and to be as uncertain in its operation
as other antimonials.</p>

<p>These contradictions are suspicious,
but if the efficacy of the medicine is
confirmed by authentic facts, the Inventor
may still be intitled to our
confidence; and for this purpose some
cases are related in which it was successfully
used: the first is that of
Mrs. Morton, on which it is remarked,
that <i>many gentlewomen were present during
her whole disorder, saw her take the
medicine, observed the effects, and are
ready to give their testimony to the truth
of what has been asserted</i>. From what
has been advanced on this subject, it
clearly appears, that the operation of
antimony is precarious, and its effects
uncertain. Not only the most skilful
physicians have given various and
contradictory opinions concerning it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but the judgment of the same person
has varied at different times<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>: it is not
therefore to be expected, that a fact,
which has not yet been agreed upon by
the most intelligent and attentive practitioners,
should be ascertained by
these charitable <i>gentlewomen</i>, who, however
sincere and humane their intentions
might be, cannot be supposed to
have any pretensions to that critical
and discriminating skill which is necessary
to determine a question so intricate.
The Inventor therefore, in
offering to the publick a proof so incompetent,
must have relied on that
credulity which, though generally abused,
is still continued.</p>

<p>But though the cases had been attested
by competent judges, yet the inferences
in favour of the powder are
not warranted by the circumstances
related. Thus Mr. French of St. Albans
street, late Surgeon of his Majesty’s
ship the Levant, “<i>having given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
tartar emetic and other medicines unsuccessfully,
prescribed the powder on the
fourth day of the fever: it was continued
on the fifth, and on the evening of
that day, the fever being entirely removed,
on account of the lowness and weakness of
the patient, a drachm of bark was given
every hour in a glass of Madeira</i><a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.” The
misrepresentation, in this case, is evident,
since the cure must be attributed,
by candid and intelligent judges, not to
the powder, but to the bark and Madeira;
and the slovenliness of the deception
is an insult to the credulity of
the publick, as this is perhaps the only
instance in which it has been pretended,
on account of lowness and weakness, to
give every hour a drachm of bark in a
glass of Madeira.</p>

<p>These are not the only circumstances
in which the evidence is deceitful;
successful cases are industriously
published, while those ending fatally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
are carefully concealed. The medicine
is frequently given in slight disorders
which could not, even by improper management,
be rendered dangerous, and
when the sick recover, its praise is
loudly proclaimed.</p>

<p>Those who use it often become insensibly
interested in advancing its reputation,
and are not only incompetent judges,
but partial in their testimony. Thus
some who, with horror and remorse have
applied for assistance, accusing themselves
of murder, and vowing, for ever, to renounce
quackery, have afterwards triumphed
and assumed the credit of cures
of which they had absolutely despaired,
though the sick were, by other means,
rescued from the danger incurred by
the severe operation of this violent remedy;
while others, shocked by the
fatal consequences of their facility and
misplaced confidence, wish to banish it
for ever from their remembrance. The
cases must therefore be dismissed as insufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to justify the claim of infallibility
to this antimonial preparation.</p>

<p>A proof of its salutary influence is
attempted to be drawn from the bills of
mortality. Fewer having, on an average,
died in the space of thirteen years,
from the year one thousand seven hundred
and fifty, to the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty-three, than in
the preceding thirteen years; this decrease
in the funerals amounting to sixty-two
thousand, two-hundred and sixty-six,
is attributed to the fever-powder<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>It might with some plausibility be
objected, that the bills of mortality being
collected from the reports of incompetent
judges, cannot be admitted
as proper evidence of the fact; but as
no extraordinary skill seems necessary
for the employment, and as the bills
cannot be supposed to be made up with
any partial intention, this argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
must be admitted; and if the deaths, by
fevers, shall be found to have decreased,
in so great proportion, since the powder
has been in general use, its reputation
will be established by the most desirable
evidence.</p>

<p>In collecting this proof, the whole
circle of disorders, accidents and casualties
has been calculated, though the
powder was then only recommended
for fevers. It has, indeed, been since
extended to other diseases, but our examination
shall be restricted to fevers,
during the period to which the Inventor
refers.</p>

<p>Though some of the cases which he relates
happened in the year one thousand
seven hundred and forty-one, yet the medicine
was not much known till one thousand
seven hundred and fifty, the æra from
which its auspicious influence on the bills
of mortality is dated. But antimonial
medicines were more in fashion before
the powder came into general use, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at any future time. Dr. Huxham having,
in the year one thousand seven
hundred and thirty-seven, recommended,
in the highest strain of panegyric,
the vinum benedictum, it was universally
adopted, though expressly condemned
by the Inventor of the fever-powder.
<i>Great numbers</i>, says he, <i>of
those whose employment it is to attend the
sick, cunningly exhibited to their patients
something, which they asserted was like the
fever-powder, and would do as well. I
leave it to the relations of those who took
the something, to judge the consequence,
for I suppose few or none of them who
were thus treated survive</i><a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>The something, it is well known, was
essence of antimony or tartar emetic, medicines
under the direction of prudent
practitioners, similar in their operation
and in their effects, not only to each
other, but also to the fever-powder; and
though the Inventor has perhaps too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
much indulged his indignation against
his competitors in the antimonial trade,
yet his general position, concerning
the fatal consequences of the universal
administration of antimonial medicines,
is well supported by the evidence to
which he has appealed, the bills of
mortality having greatly increased during
the prevalence of that practice.</p>

<p>The numbers of those who died of
fevers from the year one thousand seven
hundred and thirty-eight, to one thousand
seven hundred and fifty, including
a series of thirteen years, is fifty-five
thousand four hundred and ninety, and
those in a like series of years, immediately
succeeding, is thirty-six thousand
three hundred and seventy-two; consequently
nineteen thousand one hundred
and eighteen fewer have died in
the latter than in the former period,
and this has, with some appearance of
justice, been urged as a proof of the efficacy
of the fever-powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>But if this decrease in the funerals were
actually owing to that medicine, it should
have been still more observable in the last
ten years, when the powder has been more
universally used. But, in that period,
thirty-five thousand four hundred and
ninety-four have died, and consequently,
the number of deaths, by fevers,
have increased eight thousand seven
hundred and eighty; and if inflammation,
rash, and sore-throat, which
were included in the former calculations,
are added, the number will
amount, nearly, to ten thousand, and
therefore, on an average, <i>one thousand,
or near one-third</i> more have died, of
fevers, <i>every year</i>, in the last ten years,
while the medicine has been universally
used, than in the thirteen immediately
preceding. The proof, therefore, from
the bills of mortality is fatal to the fame
of the fever-powder, and the decrease
in the funerals during the thirteen years
to which the Inventor appeals for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
success of his antimonial powder, must be
attributed to the desertion of the antimonial
practice, and not to its prevalence.</p>

<p>But an appeal to the sum-total of
the funerals, to prove the efficacy of
the fever-powder, is unfair and inconclusive,
since a great number of deaths
happen from disorders, accidents and
casualties with which it cannot possibly
have any connection. That it might
have a fair trial, our calculation has
been restricted to fevers; and if the
other diseases, in which it is recommended,
had been included, the evidence
would have been still more unfavourable.</p>

<p>Another argument in favour of the
powder is, <i>if it had not been attended
with general success, it could not, amidst
the opposition of Physicians, have grown
into reputation</i>. But transitions, from
the highest approbation of antimony, to
the absolute condemnation of it, have
been so frequent, and are so familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to those acquainted with its history,
that no conclusion can be drawn from
its casual reputation, or transitory condemnation;
and since, in the course of
our enquiry, no advantage has been
taken of the penal laws enacted against
its use, nor of the public edicts by
which it has been prohibited, neither
can any concession be made on account
of the transient applause, <i>artfully</i>, obtained
to some of its preparations.</p>

<p>As to the opposition of physicians,
the Inventor, indeed, that the prophecy
with which he set out might be
fulfilled<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, complains, that all laws human
and divine, have been trampled
upon in opposing him; that he has
been persecuted with <i>malice, rancour,
virulence, detraction and unprovoked revenge</i>,
and that his enemies have not
only sacrificed <i>candour, honour, truth and
reputation</i>, but even the <i>lives</i> committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to their care, in order to discredit his
boasted arcanum<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>Were we not witnesses of his triumph,
we should naturally conclude that he had
suffered as a martyr in the cause of truth
and humanity. Yet we find, in his Dissertation,
many cases in which the powder
was given under the sanction of eminent
physicians, and these, too, produced
by the author, in proof of its efficacy;
though by his own account of
the medicine, it is of all others the most
improper to be used without an accurate
knowledge of its composition, and
cannot therefore be prescribed by physicians
on any justifiable principles; although
they may, from facility or complaisance,
yield to the importunity and
prejudice of the sick or their relations,
and assent, even against their better
judgement, to its administration.</p>

<p><i>When the fever-powder is given</i>, says
the Inventor, <i>no other medicine should be
taken either with it, or during the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of it. For want of this caution many
have perished. For it may be depended
upon, that in the state of credit in which
it has at present the honour of standing
amongst many of the medicinal worthies,
nothing is meant by any addition, but to
counteract or discredit the powder at the
expence of the patient’s life. It is usual
for them to say, that they are acquainted
with the preparation of the medicine, or
that they cannot use a medicine that they do
not know, just as either favours the present
intention and purpose. Now let us
suppose they do not know it, which is very
true; by what conjuration, magic, or inspiration
are they taught a method of improving,
by adding something to a medicine,
of which they are so totally ignorant, that
they choose to suffer their friends to perish
rather than employ it</i><a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>It may be left to the Author to explain
how those physicians, who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
use the powder, <i>kill</i> their friends, by
adding something to counteract or discredit
it, while from his own declaration,
we may fairly conclude that those
who <i>do use it</i>, must, in <i>his</i> opinion, be
destitute either of judgment or integrity.
<i>For supposing them</i>, says he, <i>perfectly
well skilled in the preparation and uses
of it, their behaviour is, for this very reason,
abundantly more infamous. For the same
knowledge would inform them, that no addition
can be made to it that will not diminish
its virtues</i><a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<p>But so far is this heinous charge of
committing <i>murder</i> to discredit the powder
from being supported by any shadow
of proof, that physicians, on the contrary,
have been complaisant to excess,
or culpably indolent, in suffering
the many <i>misrepresentations</i> concerning
this medicine to pass uncensured
and unexposed; and those who,
from the most laudable principles, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
refused to adopt it, are wanting to
themselves, to their profession, and to
the public, in neglecting to explain the
honourable principles on which they
have acted; while others from different
motives, <i>which they can best justify to
themselves</i>, have acquired fame and fortune
by a <i>studied</i> compliance with the
popular prejudices in favour of this
fashionable remedy.</p>

<p>In the course of more than twenty
years practice, though I have never
prescribed this medicine, yet, I have
not, after fairly declaring my opinion,
opposed its being given, when desired
by the sick or their relations; and as
the cure, where I have been concerned,
has been wholly committed to it, without
the addition of any medicine, or
even regimen, excepting what is prescribed
in the printed directions, or
what the Inventor himself has ordered,
some fair opportunities have occurred
of observing its effects, to which, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to every other information that could be
obtained, with a mind open to conviction,
I have carefully attended. But
in this, as in all our former researches,
the evidence has been unfavourable to
the fame of the powder.</p>

<p>In some instances it has occasioned
fainting, convulsions, and other violent
symptoms, which terrified those who
gave it. In all which I have seen, it has
proved unsuccessful, though, in some
cases the cure has afterwards been accomplished
by safer methods; and in those
where it was too late to use other remedies,
the sick have died, although it was
probable they might have recovered by a
different management, which has succeeded
in similar instances, but from an
abused and misplaced confidence, has
too often been set aside to make way for
this favourite medicine.</p>

<p>An argument still remains in favour
of the powder drawn from the credit
due to its Inventor. If that is impeached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by what has already been advanced,
it is only by the force of the
evidence, since all personal application
has been avoided. But as the reputation
of the medicine is chiefly supported
by an implicit confidence in the Inventor,
it is necessary, however unpleasing, that
this should also be considered.</p>

<p>When our assent is demanded, on the
credibility of the relator, to any fact
which we are not permitted to examine,
we can only judge of its probability from
his known accuracy and ability. Several
specimens of these have occurred in the
course of our enquiry. Quotations have
been misrepresented<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. Authorities misapplied<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
Evidence produced which
establishes facts, directly opposite to those
in support of which it is perverted<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.
Palpable contradictions have been pointed
out<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>; and an air of mystery and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
detected, the tendency of which,
when joined to a train of suspicious circumstances,
cannot be mistaken<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>But the inaccuracy betrayed in the
directions given with the powder, is
sufficient to put us on our guard.
<i>The best general and plain direction</i>, we
are told, <i>is to repeat half a paper, or
ten grains and a half of the powder once
in six hours<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>, but in South America they
seldom give less than twenty</i>, which the
Inventor <i>thinks right</i><a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, yet when it fell
under the direction of the navy-surgeons,
the general rule which was avowedly
intended, and is still continued, for
the common people, was found to be
fraught with danger, and the Inventor
admits that it has been necessary to reduce
the dose so low as two or three
grains<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, thereby acknowledging <i>the
best plain general direction, to be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
improper one for the common people</i>, since
no good reason can be assigned, why
ten or twenty-one grains should be
given by those who have no medical
skill, though it is judged necessary to
warn others, who may be supposed capable
of conducting its operation, and
detecting and counteracting its pernicious
effects, of the necessity of reducing
it, in some cases, to two or
three grains. The only solution of
this parodox, is, <i>there is one faith for the
learned, and another for the unlearned</i>.</p>

<p>But not to insist on the contradictions
abounding in this dissertation, one
more only shall be mentioned. No
addition, it has been said, can be made
to this medicine, by which its virtues
will not be diminished, and that
assertion has again been retracted;
but as one affirmation is as good as
another, that there may be no doubt
which is to be credited, the Inventor
<i>being extremely cautious of leading any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
into error in an affair of so much importance
as is that of life, thinks it imprudent
to neglect repeated bleeding, purges,
clysters, and all other assistances which the
art of medicine can afford</i><a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, and is <i>obliged
to own, that, as he esteemed life too
sacred to be hazarded for the sake of an
experiment, he had never neglected to call
in all other medical aids to his assistance
when he thought the case required them,
and believed they would of service</i><a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
But though he is <i>extremely cautious</i>, and
though <i>life</i> is too sacred to be hazarded,
yet the experiment of using the
powder without any addition or aid,
is still to be tried <i>throughout the whole
British dominions, and in other parts of
the world, where our commerce has conveyed
it</i><a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, excepting by the Inventor
and the Navy Surgeons, <i>who being persons
versed in practice will readily distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
when the rules laid down are punctually
to be followed and when not</i><a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>The real motives assigned for these
contradictions and this mysterious conduct,
<i>waving whatever artifices might
be employed by way of palliation or disguise,
are represented without reserve,
and with that sincerity which will stand the
strictest scrutiny</i>. The Inventor <i>was very
cautious of divulging a medicine of such
vast importance, because if it failed of
success, it would subject him to infinite
reproach. He was so ignorant as to expect
assistance and applause from every one
concerned in any branch of physic, not
considering that a miliary or nervous fever
of twenty days continuance, was attended
with greater emoluments than one
that terminated in two or three. But he
had soon an opportunity of discovering his
error, for some became his avowed enemies,
without the least pretence to any
provocation; whilst others, with the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of friendship, pointed a dagger to
his breast</i><a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, and therefore, after a contest
between simplicity and caution,
ignorance and shrewdness, the unsuspecting
Inventor <i>thought it time prudently
to consult his own interest, and the
advancement of his private fortune, by
securing to himself the exclusive privilege,
and putting it out of the power of others
to disguise, misrepresent, deny, or forge
facts</i><a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, from the parade, ostentation,
and mysterious secrecy, with which
this medicine has been published, from
its resemblance to the Berlin specific
febrifuge, from its being prepared from
an arsenical mineral, and easily converted
into a noxious substance; from the difficulty
of ascertaining the dose, and
conducting its operation, and from
the necessity of calling in other medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
aids to its assistance; from the
incompetency of the generality of the
witnesses in its favour; from the unfair
conclusions drawn from their testimony;
from the dangerous symptoms and
fatal consequences, which have followed
its administration; from the inaccuracy
and inconsistency of its Inventor; and
from the increase of the bills of mortality
during its general use, it appears,
not only, that no proof of its salutary
efficacy has been produced, but that
many circumstances and facts, which
have been perverted to that purpose,
concur to demonstrate its general and
indiscriminate application to be highly
dangerous to mankind, to whom, to
borrow the language of the Inventor,
<i>it is not material, whether they lose their
lives by ignorance, mistake, or design</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> We are told by Newman, that the utmost
caution is necessary to avoid the fumes of arsenic,
and that it is on account of the danger arising from
them that this mineral has been so little examined by
the chymists; but according to Dr. Percival’s late observations,
they seem to have been mistaken. I have,
says he, some doubt, whether the vapours of arsenic be
so poisonous as is commonly supposed, and if the candid
reader will excuse the digression, I will lay before
him my reasons for it. To solder works of silver filligree,
and other delicate manufactures of that kind, a
composition is used of which arsenic is the principal
ingredient. The solder is melted by the flame of a
lamp, directed by a blow-pipe; and this operation
cannot be performed with due accuracy, but in a close
room. The greatest part of the arsenic is evaporated by
the blast and flames, and some part also of the rest of
the solder. The workmen must constantly breath these
vapors, because there is little or no current of air to
carry them into the chimney. Yet the men appear
to enjoy as good health, and to live as long as
other artists who pursue their business in close rooms,
and use lamps. Amongst other examples of the
truth of this observation, I saw one lately at the
manufactory at Soho, near Birmingham: a man,
aged upwards of fifty years, who has soldered silver
filigree more than five and thirty years, and
has regularly passed from eight to twelve hours
daily in his occupation, and is at present fat,
strong, active, chearful, and of a complexion by
no means sickly. Neither he, nor his brother artists,
use any means to counteract the effects of
their trade. Dr. Percival’s Observations and Experiments

77, London, 1774.</p>

been applied by chymists to the harder or more fixed
parts of minerals or metals. Hoffman uses reguline
and arsenical indifferently when applied to
antimony; and Carthusier asserts that the intimate
union of the reguline part with the arsenical principle
of antimony, is the cause of its being caustic, drastic,
emetic, and virulent.</p>

De Haen, of Vienna, to a physician in England.
I have, <i>says this celebrated physician</i>, made many experiments
with hemlock, in consequence of an order
from high authority: the result was, that not one
of one hundred and twenty patients was cured or relieved
by it; many grew worse, and seven unhappy
women, with cancers in their breasts, perished in
my hands, some of whom might have been saved
by the knife. How did I intreat those to whom it
belonged to use more precaution, or at least to suspend
publishing in praise of poisons, till repeated
trials had been made by several hands, lest the public
faith should be abused, and the author rendered
ridiculous in the face of the universe. But my remonstrances
were fruitless, and, to my great concern,
my best friend abruptly fell out with me, and
I have incurred the disgrace of the best of sovereigns.</p>

<p>Since I have spoke my sentiments freely, I am
looked upon as the chief of heretics, as an enemy of
the public and of the author’s reputation; and for
this reason I have been unhappily disgraced, and
defamatory libels, of the most virulent kind, have
been printed against me. I expect yet more terrible
storms; however, I adore that Providence which
directs all for his glory and my good, from whom
I should deserve a disgrace infinitely more fearful
than that which I now suffer, if for the sake of transitory
glory, perishable treasures, or tranquillity of
life, that may be taken from me in this world, I
<i>should become a confederate with those who have thus
infamously abused the publick confidence, to the disgrace
of physick</i>. See Medical Museum, vol. III. London,
1764.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
